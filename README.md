## Time Weighted Staking

A variation on the typical token staking rewards contract which takes the length of time a depositor has been staking for as a factor in their share of the rewards. This method of distributing rewards should benefit early users who supply little capital as much as it would benefit latecomer whales supplying a large amount of capital.

The project is very much a work in progress and should not be used in a production setting in its current state.
